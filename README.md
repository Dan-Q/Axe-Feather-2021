# Axe Feather 2021

In 2004, Axe (the body spray brand owned by Unilever, also known as Lynx in some countries) released a Flash-powered interactive game that
fused full-motion video with the interactive web. The player uses a feather to tickle an attractive woman lying on a bed. Interacting with
different parts of her body lead to different reactions (some of which in turn can lead to further different reactions).

The official website was taken down early in 2009, and with the death of Flash in 2021, it became near-impossible to experience this strange
piece of advertising history. This project attempts to produce a moderatey-faithful recreation.
